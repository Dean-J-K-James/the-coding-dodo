Learn about the entity component system software pattern, and how it differs to the traditional object oriented approach.

## What is Entity Component System?

Entity Component System (ECS) is a software pattern commonly used in game development. It is designed to take full advantage of a computerâ€™s hardware to maximize performance, whilst also providing the programmer with a structured, modular, and reusable environment.

ECS, as it's name suggests, comprises three parts: entities, components, and systems. Each of these three parts have their own purpose and responsibilities within an ECS framework, and interact with each other in their own ways.

## Example

ECS is often used as an alternative to the traditional object oriented approach to software development. Although both ECS and OOP can be used alongside each other, let's have a look at an example where we use and compare both methods as alternatives. Consider a 2D platformer with the following features:

* A player controlled by a mouse and keyboard.
* A static tree.
* Two zombies controlled by AI.

### What Would this Look Like in OOP?

In object oriented programming, data and functionality are kept tightly encapsulated within classes, promoting inheritance like in the following diagram:

> **Figure 2** - Our Example Game Using OOP

Let's implement this inheritence diagram using OOP. We define a class, `GameObject` which contains all the functionality and data that is common between our features. This class could look something like this:

    class GameObject
    {
        public Sprite sprite;
        public float  x;
        public float  y;

        public void Render()
        {
            ...
        }
    }

All of our features: the player, a tree, and the zombies, require an x and y position, and a sprite to visualise them; as well as a function used to render the object to the screen. Since our tree object would not require any additional data or functionality, we could instantiate the `GameObject` class to represent the tree.

The remaining player and zombie features would need some extra functionality, some common and some unique to each. We define another class, `Character` that contains all common data and logic.

    class Character : GameObject
    {
        public int velocity;
        public int health;

        public void TakeDamage()
        {
            ...
        }
    }

In our example, both players and zombies have some health, have a velocity, and are able to take and deal damage. This functionality can be kept in the `Character` class.

Any data unique to each would be put in their own class. The player would be represented by the `Player` class.

    class Player : Character
    {
        public int potions;
        public int xp;
    }

The player would inherit the position and sprite properties from `GameObject`, inherit velocity and health from `Character`, and then define the additional data and functionality it needs in it's own class. The player in our game would be represented by an instance of the `Player` class.

The two zombies would be similar, each being represented by an instance of the `Zombie` class.

    class Zombie : Character
    {
        public int xpDropped;
    }

Any data specific to a zombie, such as xp earned when killed, will be in the `Zombie` class. Object oriented programming promotes inheritence, which uses an "is-a" relationship between classes.

### What Would this Look Like in ECS?

Entity component systems take a slightly different approach to defining objects. Whereas OOP keeps data and logic together in classes, ECS seperates data into small, reusable components, and logic into small, reusable systems.

### Entities

An entity is an individual object in the world. Whereas in OOP, objects are instances of a class, in ECS, an entity is just a unique integer. The purpose of this integer is simply to distinguish between entities. The four entities in our game would be:

* `entity = 0` represents the player.
* `entity = 1` represents the tree.
* `entity = 2` represents the first zombie.
* `entity = 3` represents the second zombie.

The entity itself contains no data or functionality; it is just an integer used for identification.

### Components

All the data associated with an entity is seperated into small, generic, and reusable components. Below are some example components:

* `Position`
* `Sprite`
* `Health`
* `AI`
* `PlayerInput`

Where possible, components should only contain primitive data types like integers or floats. For example, the following code represents the Position component:

    public struct Position
    {
        public float x;
        public float y;
    }

Components are lightweight data containers that define the attributes and state of an entity. They contain no functionality, just data. *Figure 3* shows some example components.

![Example Components](/assets/images{{ page.url}}/figure3.png)
> **Figure 3** - Example Components

Considering the four entities in our game, they could have the following components:

* `entity = 0` would have the `Position`, `Render`, `Health`, `Physics`, and `PlayerInput` components.
* `entity = 1` would have the `Position`, and `Render` components.
* `entity = 2` would have the `Position`, `Render`, `Physics`, and `AI` components.
* `entity = 3` would have the `Position`, `Render`, `Physics`, and `AI` components.

By having primitive values, components can be stored and iterated over extremely efficiently by being contigous in memory.

### Systems

Systems bring the game to life. They operate on the components attached to an entity to produce changes in the world. Some example systems could be:

* `RenderSystem` - Uses the `Position` and `Render` components.
* `HealthSystem` - Uses the `Health` component.
* `PlayerMovementSystem` - Uses the `Position` and `PlayerInput` components.

In a typical program using an ECS, each system will run once per frame. The following code example shows what the RenderSystem update function could look like:

    foreach (int e in GetEntities<Position, Render>())
    {
        var p = GetComponent<Position>(e);
        var s = GetComponent<Sprite>(e);

        render(s.sprite, p.x, p.y);
    }

In OOP, each object that needs rendering would be rendered by calling the `Render` function in the `GameObject` class. In ECS, the `RenderSystem` iterates over each entity with the `Position` and `Render` components, rendering them.
