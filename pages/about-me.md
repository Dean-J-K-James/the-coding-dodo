# About Me

I have experience working with a large variety of programming languages of different paradigms.

My journey into software development began at school, where I started with `Visual Basic`, making use of Windows Forms in Visual Studio to create a physics simulator for my A-Level project. Using what I had learned, I then started using `C#` combined with the `Unity` engine to create both 2D and 3D games. Once I started studying Computer Science at university, my portfolio of languages rapidly increased in size. Some of these languages include: `Haskell`, `Prolog`, `Java`, `C/C++` (I made a Tamagotchi with an Arduino). A particular focus at university was web development. This started with designing basic, static websites with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. Then, it expanded into server side technologies where me and my team were tasked with making a support helpdesk site in both Laravel and WordPress.
