<h2>Notice Any Problems?</h2>
<p>I always try my best to ensure my articles are the best they can be by thoroughly researching their content, testing any code, and proof reading everything. Sometimes however, problems can slip through. If you notice any mistakes, please contact me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thecodingdodo">@thecodingdodo</a> and let me know.</p>
